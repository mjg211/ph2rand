*Design of Randomized Comparative Phase II Oncology Trials with a Binary Primary Outcome*

## Description

__ph2rand__ provides a suite of functions to assist in the design of randomized comparative phase II oncology trials with a binary primary outcome variable. Specifically, support is provided to: (a) perform a sample size calculation when using one of several published designs (Jung, 2008; Jung and Sargent, 2014; Kepner, 2010; Litwin *et al*, 2017, Shan *et al*, 2013), (b) evaluate the operating characteristics of a given design, and (c) produce informative plots.

## Getting started

You can install the the latest development version of __ph2rand__, available from [GitHub](https://github.com/), with

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("mjg211/ph2rand")
```

An introductory example of how to make use of the packageâ€™s core functionality can be found below.
For further help, please contact Michael Grayling at michael.grayling@newcastle.ac.uk.

## Example: Two-stage designs

We demonstrate functionality for two-stage designs, with the approach for single-stage designs being equivalent.
First, find a two-stage design from Jung (2008) for the default parameters

```{r}
des_jung <- des_two_stage()
```

Then examine its required sample size in each arm, in each stage

```{r}
des_jung$nC
des_jung$nE
```

Next, look at its key operating characteristics

```{r}
des_jung$opchar
```

Compare this to the equivalent design from Litwin *et al* (2017)

```{r}
des_litwin_et_al <- des_two_stage(type  = "single_double",
                                  nCmax = 20L)
des_litwin_et_al$nC
des_litwin_et_al$nE
des_litwin_et_al$opchar
```

Now to that from Shan (2013)

```{r}
des_shan_et_al <- des_two_stage(type  = "barnard",
                                nCmax = 40L)
des_shan_et_al$nC
des_shan_et_al$nE
des_shan_et_al$opchar
```

And finally that from Jung and Sargent (2014)

```{r}
des_jung_sargent <- des_two_stage(type  = "fisher")
des_jung_sargent$nC
des_jung_sargent$nE
des_jung_sargent$opchar
```

We can then readily find the terminal points of any of these designs, along with their probability mass functions and operating characteristics for any true response rates.
For example, consider two scenarios given by

```{r}
pi <- rbind(c(0.1, 0.1),
            c(0.1, 0.3))
```

Then find the terminal points, probability mass functions, and operating characteristics of the Jung (2008) design with

```{r}
terminal_jung <- terminal(des_jung)
terminal_jung$terminal
pmf_jung      <- pmf(des_jung, pi)
pmf_jung$pmf
opchar_jung   <- opchar(des_jung, pi)
opchar_jung$opchar
```

Finally, we can plot various factors relating to the designs.
For example, plot the terminal points of the Jung (2008) design (with their associated decisions), along with the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the response probabilities are equal in the two arms or when the difference in the response probabilities is the chosen treatment effect

```{r}
plot(des_jung)
```

See the package vignette for further details.
