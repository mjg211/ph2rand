# ph2rand

*Design of randomized comparative phase II oncology trials*

## Description

__ph2rand__ provides a suite of functions to assist with the design and visualization of randomized comparative phase II oncology trials. Specifically, support is provided to perform a sample size calculation for each of the most popular randomized comparative phase II oncology trial designs, for both point and composite null hypotheses. A selection of plotting functions also permit the informative depiction of various important quantities.

## Getting started

You can install the the latest development version of __ph2rand__, available from [GitHub](https://github.com/), with:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("mjg211/ph2rand")
```

An introductory example of how to make use of the packageâ€™s core functionality can be found below. More detailed support is available in the package vignette, which can be accessed with `vignette("ph2rand")`. For further help, please contact Michael Grayling at michael.grayling@newcastle.ac.uk.
