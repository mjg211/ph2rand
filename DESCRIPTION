Description: Provides a suite of functions to assist in the design of randomized
    comparative phase II oncology trials with a binary primary outcome variable.
    Specifically, support is provided to: (a) perform a sample size calculation
    when using one of several published designs, (b) evaluate the operating
    characteristics of a given design, and (c) produce informative plots.
