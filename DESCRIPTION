Description: This package provides a suite of functions to assist with the
    design, analysis, and visualization of randomized phase II oncology trials.
    Specifically, support is provided to perform a sample size calculation for
    each of the most popular randomized phase II oncology trial designs, for
    both point and composite null hypotheses. Additional functions then allow
    point estimates, p-values, and confidence intervals to be determined for
    possible outcomes in these designs. A selection of plotting functions also
    permit the informative depiction of various important quantities.
