Description: ph2rand provides functions to assist with the design of randomized
    comparative phase II oncology trials that assume their primary outcome
    variable is Bernoulli distributed. Specifically, support is provided to (a)
    perform a sample size calculation when using one of several published
    designs, (b) evaluate the operating characteristics of a given design (both
    analytically and via simulation), and (c) produce informative plots.
