Description: Provides a suite of functions to assist with the design and
    visualization of randomized comparative phase II oncology trials.
    Specifically, support is provided to perform a sample size calculation for
    each of the most popular randomized comparative phase II oncology trial
    designs, for both point and composite null hypotheses. A selection of
    plotting functions also permit the informative depiction of various
    important quantities.
