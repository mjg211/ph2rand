# ph2rand

*Design of randomized phase II oncology trials*

## Description

**ph2rand** provides a suite of functions to assist with the design and
visualization of randomized comparative phase II oncology trials.
Specifically, support is provided to perform a sample size calculation
for each of the most popular randomized comparative phase II oncology
trial designs, for both point and composite null hypotheses. A selection
of plotting functions also permit the informative depiction of various
important quantities.

## Getting started

You can install the the latest development version of **ph2rand**,
available from [GitHub](https://github.com/), with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mjg211/ph2rand")
```

An introductory example of how to make use of the package’s core
functionality can be found below. More detailed support is available in
the package vignette, which can be accessed with `vignette("ph2rand")`.
