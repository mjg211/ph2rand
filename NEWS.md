# News: ph2rand

## v.0.1

- Support established for a variety of single-stage and two-stage randomized
comparative designs, assuming a binary primary outcome variable
(`des_one_stage()` and `des_two_stage()`). In addition, functions created to
return PMFs (`pmf()`), terminal points (`terminal()`), and operating
characteristics (`opchar()`) of such designs. As too are a selection of S3
method functions (`plot.ph2rand_des()`, `plot.ph2rand_pmf()`,
`plot.ph2rand_terminal()`, and `summary.ph2rand_des()`).
