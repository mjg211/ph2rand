# News: ph2rand

## v.0.1

- Support established for a variety of single-stage and two-stage randomized
comparative designs, assuming a binary primary outcome variable
(`des_one_stage()` and `des_two_stage()`). In addition, functions created to
return PMFs (`pmf()`) and terminal points (`terminal()`) of such designs. As too
are a selection of S3 method functions (`plot.ph2rand_des()`,
`print.ph2rand_des()`, and `summary.ph2rand_des()`).
